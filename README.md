# HTML TEXT FILE TO XML FORMATTER
## How to use this code 
After downloading the code from my repository, run the `file_to_xml_formatter.cpp` file by typing `g++ file_to_formatter.cpp && ./a.out` this would convert the demo text in `text_file.txt` to xml format
<br><strong><i>Note: the output would be printed in your console (this is a console application and has no Graphical User interface (GUI)).</i></strong>

### Follow these simple steps
1. Open the text_file.txt

2. Edit the text in the text_file or copy and paste your hymn. If the hymn has a chorus, write "chorus" or "chorus:" above it ensuring to leave a line space after every stanza or chorus
